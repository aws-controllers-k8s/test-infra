This directory contains that autogenerated `jobs.yaml`, `labels.yaml` and utilities for the generation.

`jobs.yaml` and `labels.yaml` are loaded into prow cluster as k8s config-map.
This config map serves as source of truth for prow-job configuration. See `test-infra/flux`

`jobs.yaml` consists of three sections:

a) `periodics` : prow-jobs that run periodically

b) `presubmits`: prow-jobs that run before the merge happens on git repository. Ex: PR creation

c) `postsubmits`: prow-jobs that run after the code change is merged into git repository or a new release is created for git repository.

`labels.yaml` consists of two sections:

a) `default` global configuration to be applied to all repos

b) `repos`: list of repos with specific configuration to be applied in addition to default

## How do I update jobs.yaml ?

Please do NOT manually update jobs.yaml file.

Update the corresponding jinja template in prow/jobs/jinja path and then run `make build-prow-jobs`
from the test-infra repository root.

You can either update the existing .jinja2 files or add new file which will be picked up and incorporated
in autogenerated jobs.yaml

## How do I update labels.yaml

Please do NOT manually update labels.yaml file.

Update the jinja template in prow/jobs/jinja/config path and then run `make build-labels-config`
from the test-infra repository root.
